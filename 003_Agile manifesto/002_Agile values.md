### Agile Manifesto: Values and Principles

#### Overview of Agile
- **Agile Mindset**: A mindset focused on adaptability, collaboration, and delivering value.
- **Common Misconception**: Agile is not just about ceremonies (e.g., stand-ups, sprint planning). These are mechanical elements.
- **Core Concept**: Agile is a mindset, guided by four values and twelve principles.

#### Four Agile Values
In 2001, 17 software developers met in Snowbird, Utah, and created the Agile Manifesto to address the limitations of the then-popular Waterfall method. They identified key values to guide agile practices:

1. **Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools**
   - Prioritizes direct communication among team members and stakeholders.
   - Emphasizes collaboration and face-to-face interactions.
   - Waterfall Issue: Heavy reliance on processes and tools often hampers communication.

2. **Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Focuses on delivering functional software frequently.
   - Documentation should support development, not hinder it.
   - Waterfall Issue: Excessive time spent on documentation delays actual development.

3. **Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation**
   - Encourages ongoing collaboration between developers and customers.
   - Seeks continuous feedback to adapt and meet customer needs.
   - Waterfall Issue: Prolonged contract negotiations often delay development and reduce flexibility.

4. **Responding to Change Over Following a Plan**
   - Advocates for flexibility and adaptability in development.
   - Allows teams to pivot based on feedback, market changes, or new information.
   - Waterfall Issue: Rigid plans are difficult to change, hindering responsiveness to new requirements or market conditions.
