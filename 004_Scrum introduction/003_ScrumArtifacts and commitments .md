### Artifacts and Commitments in Scrum

Scrum includes three key artifacts:

1. **Product Backlog**
2. **Sprint Backlog**
3. **Increment**

Let's discuss these artifacts and their commitments in detail using an example of building a website.

#### Product Backlog

**Definition**: The Product Backlog is a list of all desired work on the project. It includes both high-level and detailed requirements.

**Example Process**:
1. **Idea Generation**: A product director or stakeholders come up with the idea of building a website.
2. **Product Goal**: The Product Owner (PO) works with the Scrum team to craft a product goal, e.g., "Creation of a new website."
3. **Requirement Gathering**: The PO collaborates with stakeholders to understand customer needs and documents these as requirements in the Product Backlog.

**Structure**:
- **Bottom**: Rough, high-level requirements that are not yet fully refined.
- **Middle**: More detailed, medium-priority requirements that are better understood but not as refined as the top-level ones.
- **Top**: Highly refined, high-priority requirements that are ready to be picked up in the next sprint.

**Commitment**: The commitment for the Product Backlog is the **Product Goal**. This ensures that there is a single, clear objective guiding the Scrum team’s efforts.

#### Sprint Backlog

**Definition**: The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks or items selected from the Product Backlog that the Scrum team plans to work on during a sprint.

**Example Process**:
1. **Sprint Planning**: The PO and the Scrum team (developers and Scrum Master) hold a sprint planning meeting.
2. **Selection of PBIs**: The PO presents the top Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to the team, who then ask for clarifications and provide estimates.
3. **Sprint Goal**: Based on estimates and team capacity, the team selects PBIs to work on and sets a Sprint Goal, e.g., "Design the basic structure of the website."

**Structure**:
- **Top-Level Items**: Items that are small, refined, and can be completed within one sprint.
- **Definition of Done**: Each item in the Sprint Backlog must meet the team’s quality standards.

**Commitment**: The commitment for the Sprint Backlog is the **Sprint Goal**, which is a short-term target achievable within the sprint duration.

#### Increment

**Definition**: The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a sprint, meeting the Definition of Done. It represents a usable, potentially shippable product.

**Example Process**:
1. **Sprint Execution**: Developers work on the tasks from the Sprint Backlog, aiming to complete them by the end of the sprint.
2. **Delivery**: By the end of the sprint, the team delivers an Increment, e.g., the basic structure of the website, which is usable by the end customer.

**Commitment**: The commitment for the Increment is the **Definition of Done**, which ensures that the increment meets the required quality standards before delivery.

### Importance of Commitments

**Purpose**: Commitments provide a clear focus, transparency, and measurable progress for the team.

- **Focus**: Commitments like the Product Goal and Sprint Goal keep the team aligned and focused on what needs to be achieved.
- **Transparency**: Commitments make it clear what the team is working towards and the status of progress.
- **Measurable Progress**: By comparing the increment with the Sprint Goal, the team can measure how much has been achieved and how far they are from their goals.


### Summary

Scrum artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment) and their respective commitments (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, and Definition of Done) are essential for ensuring clarity, focus, and measurable progress within the Scrum framework. The roles within Scrum work together to uphold these principles, promoting a self-managing and collaborative environment.
