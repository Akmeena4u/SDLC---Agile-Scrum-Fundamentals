### Overview of Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a methodology used to scale agile practices across large organizations. It is implemented at three main levels: Portfolio Level, Agile Release Train (ART) Level, and Agile Team Level.

#### Agile Team Level

**Stakeholders in an Agile Team:**
1. **Product Owner:**
   - Manages the team backlog, which contains all the work the team needs to do.
   - Ensures that the most important tasks are prioritized.
2. **Scrum Master/Team Coach:**
   - Facilitates the team processes and helps resolve any issues.
   - Ensures the team follows agile practices.
3. **Developers/Testers:**
   - Design, develop, code, test, and release the product.
   - Work collaboratively to meet the team’s goals.

**User Stories:**
- **User Stories** are the smallest units of work, representing customer requirements.
- **Types of User Stories:**
  1. **Blue Stories:** Represent business requirements (e.g., adding a search feature to a website).
  2. **Red Stories:** Represent enabler stories, which are technical tasks needed to support the blue stories (e.g., setting up a database to store book information).

**Iterations (Sprints):**
- An iteration, also known as a sprint, is a two-week cycle.
- During each sprint, the team selects user stories from the backlog, develops them, tests them, and delivers a working product.
- User stories should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint. If not, they should be broken down into smaller stories.

**Example:**
- If a team is building a website to sell books, a **blue story** might be the ability to search for books. A **red story** could be setting up the database where the book details are stored.

#### Agile Release Train (ART) Level

**Features:**
- Features are larger pieces of functionality that may require several sprints to complete.
- **Types of Features:**
  1. **Blue Features:** Represent business needs.
  2. **Red Features:** Represent enabler features, which provide the technical foundation needed to support the blue features.

**Stakeholders in ART:**
1. **Product Management:**
   - Manages the ART backlog, which contains all the features to be developed.
2. **System Architect:**
   - Provides architectural guidance and ensures the system’s design aligns with the organization’s goals.
3. **Release Train Engineer (RTE):**
   - Facilitates ART-level events and acts as the Chief Scrum Master.

**Planning Interval (PI):**
- The ART operates within a Planning Interval (PI), which is a time-boxed period of 8-12 weeks.
- A PI consists of multiple sprints. For example, an 8-week PI would have 4 sprints (each 2 weeks long).
- Each feature should fit within a single PI. If it doesn’t, it should be broken down into smaller features.

**Example:**
- Think of building a 100-floor building. Each floor represents a feature, and each room within a floor represents a user story.

#### Portfolio Level

**Epics:**
- Epics are the largest units of work, representing significant customer needs or business initiatives.
- **Types of Epics:**
  1. **Blue Epics:** Represent business epics.
  2. **Red Epics:** Represent enabler epics, which are technical initiatives that support the business epics.

**Stakeholders at Portfolio Level:**
1. **Lean Portfolio Management:**
   - Prioritizes epics and allocates budgets.
   - Decides the order in which epics will be developed.
2. **Enterprise Architect:**
   - Develops the organization’s architectural strategy.
   - Ensures alignment with the organization’s goals.
3. **Program Management Office (PMO):**
   - Manages metrics and measurements for the ARTs.

**Example:**
- The entire 100-floor building represents an epic. Each floor (feature) contains multiple rooms (user stories), making up the entire building.

### Summary

1. **Agile Team Level:**
   - Small, cross-functional teams working on user stories within two-week sprints.
   - Stories are managed by the Product Owner, facilitated by the Scrum Master, and developed by the team.

2. **Agile Release Train (ART) Level:**
   - Multiple Agile teams work together to deliver features.
   - Managed by Product Management, guided by System Architects, and facilitated by the Release Train Engineer.

3. **Portfolio Level:**
   - Manages large-scale epics and overall strategic direction.
   - Handled by Lean Portfolio Management, Enterprise Architects, and the Program Management Office.

SAFe provides a structured approach to scaling agile practices across large organizations, ensuring that work is aligned with business goals and efficiently delivered from the smallest user stories to the largest epics.
