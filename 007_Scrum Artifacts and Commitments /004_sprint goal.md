1. **Definition**:
   - The Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Scrum team about why a particular sprint exists and what its objective is.

2. **Part of Sprint Backlog**:
   - It's included in the Sprint Backlog along with other details like selected PBIs (Product Backlog Items) and the plan for delivery.

3. **Guidance and Focus**:
   - Provides guidance and focus on how functionality should be implemented during the sprint.
   - Helps developers understand the context of each PBI (title, description, acceptance criteria) and directs their effort towards the sprint goal.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Allows flexibility in modifying PBIs to ensure they still align with the sprint goal.
   - Enables the team to choose feasible solutions while working on PBIs.

5. **Learning and Adaptation**:
   - As the team learns more during the sprint, they can renegotiate the scope of PBIs with the product owner without changing the sprint goal.
   - PBIs that are refined highly and given priority are selected for the sprint, while others continue to evolve and be refined.

6. **Example**:
   - For a book-selling website, a sprint goal could be the delivery of the book search functionality.

7. **Multiple Teams**:
   - If multiple Scrum teams work on the same product, each team will have its own sprint goal for their respective sprints.
