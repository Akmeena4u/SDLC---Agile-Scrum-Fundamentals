### Use of Scrum Framework at Team Level

In this section, we will discuss how the Scrum framework is used at the team level within the SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework). 

### Framework Choices
- **Scrum Framework**: Primarily used when building new features, stories, or functionalities.
- **Kanban Framework**: Used for customer service or bug fixes where the ticket sizes are small.

### Starting the Process
- **User Stories Allocation**: Stories are allocated to the agile team during the planning exercise.
- **Team Backlog**: All allocated user stories are moved to the team-level backlog.
  - **Red User Stories**: Enabler stories, technical building blocks for other stories.
  - **Blue User Stories**: Business stories that deliver direct value.

### Prioritization and Planning
1. **Prioritization**: Product Owner prioritizes the stories in the team backlog.
2. **Iteration Planning**:
   - **Capacity Determination**: Determine the working days available for each team member within the sprint.
   - **Story Estimation**: Estimate the effort required for each story, refining details and asking questions to the Product Owner.
   - **Effort Matching**: Match the team’s capacity to the effort required to deliver the stories.
   - **Iteration Backlog**: Highest priority stories that can be completed within the sprint are moved to the iteration backlog.
   - **Iteration Goal**: The team defines the iteration goal based on the stories in the iteration backlog.

### Iteration Execution
- **Timebox**: Each iteration is a two-week interval during which the team designs, builds, tests, and delivers the user stories.
- **Daily Team Sync**:
  - **Duration**: 15 minutes
  - **Discussion Points**: Progress on user stories, impediments, and plan adjustments.
  - **Frequency**: Daily

### Review and Retrospective
- **Iteration Review**:
  - **Progress Verification**: Product Owner verifies the progress of the stories against the definition of done.
  - **Functionality Demonstration**: Team demonstrates the functionality to the Product Owner and stakeholders to gather feedback.
  - **Release**: Completed functionality is combined with other teams' work and released to production.

- **Iteration Retrospective**:
  - **Review Process**: Team reviews their processes, tools, and ways of working.
  - **Evaluation**: Identify what went well and what didn’t.
  - **Improvement**: Agree on improvement items and prioritize the highest one to include in the next iteration backlog.

This process ensures continuous improvement and adaptation, allowing the team to deliver high-quality software in a structured and efficient manner.
