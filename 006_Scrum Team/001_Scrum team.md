**Scrum Team:**
- **Composition:** The Scrum team is comprised of three primary roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers (up to 8 members).
- **Fundamental Unit:** The Scrum team is considered the fundamental unit of Scrum methodology.
- **No Hierarchy:** Within the Scrum team, there are no hierarchical structures or sub-teams. All members are equal in terms of authority and responsibility.
- **Focused on Objectives:** The entire Scrum team is focused on achieving a single objective at a time, typically the Product Goal.
- **Cross-Functional:** Members of the Scrum team possess a diverse set of skills necessary to deliver value in each Sprint, including requirements analysis, coding, testing, and deployment.
- **Self-Managed:** The Scrum team is self-managed, meaning they internally decide how to organize their work, allocate tasks, and collaborate effectively.
- **Optimal Size:** The recommended size for a Scrum team is 10 or fewer members to facilitate effective communication, collaboration, and agility.
- **Empowered:** The organization empowers the Scrum team to manage their own work, make decisions, and deliver valuable increments of the product consistently.
- **Responsibility:** The Scrum team is collectively responsible for all product-related activities, including stakeholder collaboration, verification (testing), maintenance, operations, experimentation, and research and development.
- **Complexity Management:** Smaller teams are preferred as they are more agile and can manage complexity effectively through empirical processes.
