## Core Concepts of Scrum

### Foundational Principles
1. **Empiricism**: Adapting based on knowledge gained. Learn from experience and use that knowledge to adjust your ways of working or your product.
2. **Lean Thinking**: Reducing waste, whether it be unnecessary steps in processes or additional unneeded features in products.

### Three Pillars
1. **Transparency**: Clear visibility of processes and work for all involved.
2. **Inspection**: Regular checks to ensure progress and identify variances.
3. **Adaptation**: Adjusting processes and plans based on inspection results to improve outcomes.

### Characteristics of Scrum
- **Lightweight**: The Scrum framework is concise and straightforward, making it easy to understand the basics. However, mastering Scrum requires deeper understanding and practice.
- **Defined Structure**: Scrum includes specific accountabilities, events, artifacts, and rules that bind these elements together.

## Scrum Components

### Accountabilities
1. **Product Owner**: Maximizes the value of the product by managing the product backlog and ensuring the team is delivering value.
2. **Scrum Master**: Facilitates Scrum processes, coaches the team on Scrum practices, and helps remove impediments. Not a manager or project manager.
3. **Developers**: Build and test the product increment, handle detailed work, including design if needed.

### Events (Time-boxed)
1. **Sprint**: A fixed time period (maximum of one month) during which a potentially shippable product increment is created.
2. **Sprint Planning**: A meeting where the Scrum team plans the work to be performed during the Sprint. Time-boxed to a maximum of 8 hours for a one-month Sprint.
3. **Daily Scrum**: A 15-minute daily meeting for the development team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
4. **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the Sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed. Time-boxed to a maximum of 4 hours for a one-month Sprint.
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting for the Scrum team to inspect and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. Time-boxed to a maximum of 3 hours for a one-month Sprint.

### Artifacts
1. **Product Backlog**: An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product, maintained by the Product Owner.
2. **Sprint Backlog**: The set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product increment and achieving the Sprint Goal.
3. **Increment**: The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. The increment must meet the definition of done and be in a usable condition.

### Commitments for Each Artifact
1. **Product Goal**: Commitment for the Product Backlog, providing a long-term objective for the Scrum team.
2. **Sprint Goal**: Commitment for the Sprint Backlog, giving the team a single objective to achieve during the Sprint.
3. **Definition of Done**: Commitment for the Increment, ensuring all increments meet a shared understanding of completeness.

### Scrum Values
1. **Commitment**: The team is dedicated to achieving its goals.
2. **Focus**: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum team.
3. **Openness**: The Scrum team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
4. **Respect**: Scrum team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
5. **Courage**: Scrum team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

## Summary
To understand Scrum, one must know the three accountabilities (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers), five events (Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and three artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment) along with their respective commitments (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, Definition of Done). The framework is designed to be lightweight and easy to understand but requires practice and dedication to master.
