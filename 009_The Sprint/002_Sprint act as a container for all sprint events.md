1. **Sprint as an Event Container**:
   - Each Sprint in Scrum contains several key events.
   - These events are Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

2. **Sprint Events**:
   - Sprint starts with Sprint Planning, where the team plans the work for the sprint.
   - Daily Scrum happens every day to update progress and plan for the next 24 hours.
   - Sprint Review occurs at the end to showcase the product increment to stakeholders.
   - Sprint Retrospective reflects on the sprint and identifies areas for improvement.

3. **Sequential Process**:
   - After one sprint ends, the next sprint begins immediately, maintaining a continuous development cycle.
   - Inside each sprint, these events are contained and follow a structured order for effective collaboration and progress tracking.

4. **Purpose**:
   - Sprint acts as a time-boxed container that organizes and guides the team through iterative development, feedback loops, and continuous improvement.
