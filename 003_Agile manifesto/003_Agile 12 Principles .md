### Agile Manifesto: 12 Principles

#### Principle 1: Satisfy the Customer
- **Highest Priority**: Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- **Key Idea**: Deliver early (at least once a month) and continuously, iteration after iteration.

#### Principle 2: Welcome Changing Requirements
- **Embrace Change**: Even late in development, agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- **Example**: Companies adapting to new technologies like ChatGPT must continuously revise their roadmaps to stay relevant.

#### Principle 3: Deliver Working Software Frequently
- **Frequent Delivery**: Deliver working software from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for shorter timescales.
- **Key Idea**: Ensure the delivered software is usable and functional.

#### Principle 4: Business and Developers Work Together Daily
- **Collaboration**: Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- **Key Idea**: Reduce communication gaps and ensure a shared understanding of requirements by working closely.

#### Principle 5: Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals
- **Empowerment**: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
- **Key Idea**: Avoid micromanagement and create an environment where teams can thrive and innovate.

#### Principle 6: Face-to-Face Conversation
- **Effective Communication**: The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a team is face-to-face conversation.
- **Key Idea**: Face-to-face communication reduces miscommunication and speeds up decision-making.

#### Principle 7: Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress
- **Measure Success**: Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- **Key Idea**: Focus on delivering functional software regularly rather than excessive documentation.

#### Principle 8: Sustainable Development
- **Sustainable Pace**: Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- **Key Idea**: Avoid burnout by maintaining a steady, manageable workload.

#### Principle 9: Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence
- **Quality Focus**: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- **Key Idea**: Develop the architecture and design iteratively to adapt to changing requirements.

#### Principle 10: Simplicity
- **Maximize Work Not Done**: Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
- **Key Idea**: Focus on essential features that add value and avoid unnecessary work.

#### Principle 11: Self-Organizing Teams
- **Empower Teams**: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- **Key Idea**: Empower teams to manage themselves and innovate without micromanagement.

#### Principle 12: Reflect and Adjust Regularly
- **Continuous Improvement**: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
- **Key Idea**: Use retrospectives to identify improvements and implement changes in future sprints.
