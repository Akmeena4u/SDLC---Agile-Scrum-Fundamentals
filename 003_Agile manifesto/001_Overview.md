### Agile Manifesto Overview

**Agile Overview:**
- **Mindset:** Agile is a mindset, not just a set of practices or meetings. It requires an agile way of thinking and acting.
- **Misconception:** Merely holding meetings like stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives does not constitute being agile. These are mechanical ceremonies.
- **Core Concept:** Agile mindset is crucial for both leadership and team members.

**Agile Values:**
- **Foundation:** The agile mindset is based on four core values.
- **Guidance:** These values guide the behavior and practices of agile practitioners.

**Agile Principles:**
- **Support:** The four values are supported by 12 agile principles.
- **Implementation:** These principles help in implementing the agile values effectively in various scenarios.

**Agile Practices:**
- **Application:** Agile principles are applied through various practices such as:
  - **Scrum:** A framework for managing and completing complex projects.
  - **Self-Organizing Teams:** Teams that manage themselves and are responsible for their work.
  - **Definition of Done:** A clear set of criteria that must be met for a task to be considered complete.
  - **Cadence:** The rhythm or regular intervals of work and review.
  - **Time Box:** A fixed, maximum period during which activities must be completed.
  - **Retrospective:** A meeting held at the end of each iteration to reflect on what went well and what can be improved.

**Agile Frameworks and Tools:**
- **Variety:** There are multiple frameworks and tools supporting agile practices, including but not limited to:
  - **Scrum:** The most popular agile framework, but not the only one.
