### Definition of Scrum

**Scrum** is a lightweight framework designed to help people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. 

**Scrum helps teams:** 
- Develop products or services in any context.
- Generate value through adaptive solutions.
- Solve complex problems by iteratively improving and adapting solutions based on feedback.

### High-Level Overview of Scrum Framework

**Scrum Master:** 
- Fosters an environment for effective collaboration.
- Ensures that Scrum principles and practices are followed.

**Product Owner:** 
- Orders the product backlog to maximize value delivery.
- Ensures that the most valuable items are worked on first.

**Scrum Team:** 
- Develops the product increment.
- Works on a selection of items from the product backlog during a sprint.
- Collaborates with stakeholders to inspect and adapt the product increment.

### Scrum Artifacts and Their Commitments

1. **Product Backlog:**
   - Ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product.
   - Managed by the Product Owner.
   - Represents the "What" in terms of product requirements.

2. **Sprint Backlog:**
   - Selection of items from the product backlog planned for the current sprint.
   - Includes a plan for delivering the product increment and achieving the sprint goal.
   - Represents the "How" the team will work during the sprint.


### Implementing Scrum

Scrum is iterative and incremental, focusing on delivering small, usable segments of the product to gather feedback and adapt solutions. The process involves:

1. **Sprint Planning:**
   - Scrum team decides on the work to be done in the sprint.
   - Results in a sprint backlog.

2. **Daily Scrum:**
   - Short, daily meeting to plan the day's work and identify impediments.

3. **Sprint Review:**
   - Scrum team and stakeholders inspect the product increment.
   - Feedback is gathered to adapt the product in the next sprint.

4. **Sprint Retrospective:**
   - Scrum team reflects on the past sprint to identify improvements for the next sprint.

### Summary

- **Scrum** is a lightweight framework for solving complex problems and generating value through adaptive solutions.
- **Roles** include Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Scrum Team.
- **Artifacts** include Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment.
- The **iterative process** involves planning, daily meetings, reviews, and retrospectives to continuously improve and adapt.
