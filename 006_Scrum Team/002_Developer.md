**Developer Accountability:**
1. **Planning for the Sprint:**
   - Developers are responsible for creating a plan for the Sprint, known as the Sprint Backlog. This plan outlines the tasks and activities they will undertake during the Sprint.
2. **Ensuring Quality:**
   - Developers are accountable for maintaining high-quality standards by adhering to the Definition of Done (DoD). The DoD specifies the criteria that must be met for each Product Backlog item to be considered complete.
3. **Adapting to Sprint Goals:**
   - Developers adapt their plans daily to align with the Sprint Goal. They adjust their tasks and priorities based on new information, challenges, or feedback received during the Sprint.
4. **Mutual Accountability:**
   - Within the Scrum team, developers hold each other accountable as professionals. This mutual accountability ensures that everyone is committed to delivering the Sprint's objectives successfully.
5. **Skill Diversity:**
   - Developers possess a diverse range of skills relevant to their domain or product. These skills can include programming, software design, server management, database design, testing, documentation, and user interface design.
6. **Usable Increment Creation:**
   - Developers are committed to delivering a usable increment of the product at the end of each Sprint. This increment should be functional, tested, and potentially shippable to stakeholders.

Key Points:
- Developers contribute to sprint planning, quality assurance, adaptation to sprint goals, and creating usable increments.
- Their skills are diverse and tailored to the specific needs of the product or domain they are working in.
- Developers work collaboratively within the Scrum team, supporting each other and upholding professional standards to achieve Sprint objectives effectively.
